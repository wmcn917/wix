For CSS:
Paste here: https://spinitron.com/member/stationcss.php
To display custom CSS, link to Spinitron and include "css=true" (or "css=stylesheeturi") in the URL.

View the schedule with CSS enabled here: http://spinitron.com/radio/playlist.php?station=wmcn&ptype=d&css=true&show=schedule
Presumably custom styling also works for playlist view??? but I have only tested it with the schedule ...

Demo CSS was found here: https://bitbucket.org/spinitron/spinitron.bitbucket.org/raw/130b30392284671d5038074efb0bba49c9134934/styles.css
Then further customized by using the browser Web inspector to identify element names.
Some elements that are more involved to customize use images for the background
eg. the rounded top and bottom of the schedule hover pop-out: http://spinitron.com/img/bg-bot-s.png, http://spinitron.com/img/bg-bot.png, etc.
